## 🏛️ Overview & What the App Has

The application is engineered as a clean, single-codebase Android Gradle project (`ai.arena.mobile`) designed to run seamlessly across all modern Android versions (Android 8.0 Oreo through Android 15+).

| Capability | Current Implementation Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Connection Architecture** | **100% Standalone** direct HTTPS to `https://arena.ai` (no companion server, proxy, or LAN required) |
| **Android Version Support** | **Android 8.0 (API 26) through Android 15 (API 34/35)** |
| **Scrolling & Gestures** | **Smooth In-App Scrolling + page-aware pull-to-refresh**: the gesture only arms at the true top of the page (nested scrollers included), so scrolling up in chat never reloads or wipes conversations |
| **Self-Updater** | **Verified In-App GitHub Releases Updater**: checks on launch, on resume and after navigation (15-minute throttle, 5-minute retry after a failure), progress and cancel, "skip this version", zero permanent UI clutter |
| **File & Image Uploads** | **Multi-File Chooser (`ClipData`)**: Robust MIME type parsing for `.jpg`, `.png`, and images for Vision Arena, plus **direct camera capture** for `<input capture>` |
| **Downloads** | **Real DownloadManager downloads** with the WebView's session cookies, plus **`blob:` and `data:` exports** written to Downloads |
| **Web Capability Bridge** | **Native JS dialogs**, **fullscreen HTML5 video**, **before-unload guard**, **`intent://` deep links**, **Android share sheet** via `navigator.share` |
| **Resilience** | **WebView renderer recovery**, HTTP 5xx / TLS / offline handling with backoff auto-reconnect |
| **Self-Updater Integrity** | SHA-256 + package name + version code + signer certificate verified **before** the installer opens |
| **Branding & Iconography** | **Official Classical Ionic Pillar** vector & raster mipmaps across all screen densities (`mdpi`–`xxxhdpi`) |
| **Offline Resilience** | **5-Second Auto-Reconnect Engine** with AMOLED reconnect screen, live countdown & auto-retry |
| **Packaging & Signing** | **Full APK Signature Scheme v1, v2 & v3** with 4-byte zip alignment (`zipalign`) |
| **Security & Privacy** | **Zero Telemetry**, Geolocation disabled, File scheme access disabled, Cleartext traffic blocked |
| **Navigation & History** | **Predictive Back Navigation** (`OnBackPressedCallback`), strict Navigation Allow-List |
| **User Experience** | **Session Cookie Persistence**, **OAuth Popup Windows** (`onCreateWindow`), **AMOLED Theme** |

## 🎮 How to Use the App

Once installed on your Android device, the app gives you the full Arena benchmarking experience:

1. **Pairwise Blind Battles (Chatbot Arena):**
   - Tap into the **Arena (battle)** tab.
   - Enter your prompt or coding problem into the text box.
   - Two state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.1) generate responses anonymously side-by-side.
   - Vote on which model provided the superior answer: **Model A is better**, **Model B is better**, **Tie**, or **Both are bad**.
   - After voting, model identities are revealed and your vote contributes to LMSYS's live global Elo leaderboard.

2. **Multimodal Vision Battles:**
   - Tap into the **Vision** tab.
   - Use the native file picker to upload one or more benchmark images (diagrams, photos, UI screenshots).
   - Scroll up and down comfortably to review your uploaded images and battle responses without any accidental page reloads.

3. **Coding & Hard Prompts Arenas:**
   - Benchmark complex algorithmic problems, code refactoring, logic puzzles, and difficult multi-step queries under specialized categories.

4. **Leaderboards & Model Rankings:**
   - Browse the live, crowd-sourced leaderboard table to review model Elo ratings, 95% confidence intervals, and category rankings (Overall, Coding, Hard Prompts, Vision, French, etc.).

5. **Direct Model Chat:**
   - Switch to **Direct Chat** mode when you want to interact directly with a specific LLM without blind voting.

6. **Automatic In-App Updates:**
   - Whenever an update or fix is released on GitHub, the app detects it automatically in the background and asks if you would like to download and install the update.

## 🔍 Detailed Feature Deep Dives

### 1. Smooth Scrolling & Pull-to-Refresh (No Accidental Reloads)

Arena.ai renders chats, battles and leaderboards inside nested scrollable containers (`overflow-y: scroll/auto`). The Android WebView's root window therefore stays at scroll position `0` even while a conversation is scrolled deep into history, so a naive pull-to-refresh wrapper mistook ordinary "scroll up through a battle" drags for a refresh, reloading the page and wiping the conversation and uploads.

The gesture is now page-aware instead of disabled:

- **The page decides.** A small shim (`VIEWPORT_SHIM_JS`, injected only on Arena origins) tracks the root document *and* every visible nested scroller, and posts only state changes over the origin-locked `arenaAndroid` bridge.
- **The gesture is armed only at the true top.** `swipeRefreshLayout.setOnChildScrollUpCallback(...)` consults `canPullToRefresh()`, which requires `pageAtTop && !pageLoading && getScrollY() <= 0`. Scrolling up inside a chat leaves the gesture disarmed, so the old accidental-reload bug cannot come back.
- **Pull down at the top to reload.** The gesture reloads the current page (`view.reload()`, preserving the URL and in-page state such as the open chat) and shows the standard spinner until the page finishes. On the reconnect screen the same gesture retries the connection immediately.
- **Safe fallback.** If the WebView is too old for the WebMessage bridge, the gesture simply stays disabled rather than risking an accidental reload.

---

### 2. In-App Automated Self-Updater from GitHub Releases

The application includes an integrated background updater (`AppUpdateManager`) that keeps the app up-to-date with the latest community fixes and releases from GitHub:

- **Zero Additional UI Clutter:** The updater does not add any intrusive toolbars, banners, or floating buttons to the interface. The app remains clean and full-screen.
- **Automated Background Verification:** The updater queries `https://api.github.com/repos/Mr-Nobody-Anonymous/arena-ai-android/releases/latest` on app start, whenever the app returns to the foreground, and after a page finishes loading. Successful checks are throttled to one per 15 minutes (a fraction of GitHub's 60/hour unauthenticated quota); a failed check is retried after 5 minutes instead of being silenced for the whole interval.
- **Semantic Version Checking:** Compares the remote release tag (e.g., `v1.0.4`) against the installed version name, ignores drafts and pre-releases, and remembers the version the user skipped.
- **No nagging:** the same release is offered at most once per 12 hours even across restarts, and only once per app process.
- **Native User Prompt:** When a newer release is detected, the app presents a clean native `AlertDialog`:
  > **Update Available**  
  > *A new version of Arena AI (v1.0.2) is available with fixes and updates.*  
  > *Would you like to download and install this update?*  
  > **[Update Now]** / **[Later]**
- **Seamless Download & Package Installation:**
  - Upon user confirmation, downloads `ArenaAI.apk` directly into the app's secure cache directory (`updates/ArenaAI-update.apk`).
  - Follows HTTP redirects (e.g., AWS S3 release assets).
  - Uses `androidx.core.content.FileProvider` and launches `Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)` with MIME type `application/vnd.android.package-archive` to trigger Android's system package installer.
  - Automatically guides the user if "Install unknown apps" permission is required on Android 8.0+.

---

### 3. Enhanced Multi-File & Image Upload Bridge

Uploading images for Arena Vision battles is fully optimized:
- **Intelligent MIME Parsing:** Parses `accept` attributes, supporting comma-separated formats (`image/jpeg,image/png`), extension formats (`.jpg,.png`), and wildcard image selection (`image/*`).
- **Multi-File Selection:** Fully supports `ClipData` multi-selection so multiple benchmark images can be uploaded simultaneously.
- **Camera Capture:** When a page sets `capture` on a file input (for example a Vision prompt photographed on the spot), the chooser offers the system camera alongside the file picker. The capture is written through the app's `FileProvider`.
- **Cancellation & Failure Safety:** Guarantees that `filePathCallback.onReceiveValue(null)` is called if file selection is cancelled or interrupted, preventing the WebView from locking up.
- **Persistent State:** Uploaded images and prompts remain intact because scroll gestures no longer trigger accidental page reloads.

---

### 4. 5-Second Intelligent Auto-Reconnect Engine

Mobile network connectivity often drops when transitioning between Wi-Fi and mobile data or passing through dead zones. Rather than displaying an ugly default Chromium error screen (`net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`), this client features an integrated auto-reconnect engine:

- **Error Interception:** When WebView detects network interruption (`onReceivedError`), it immediately renders an AMOLED `#000000` reconnect view.
- **Visual Design:** Displays the authentic Classical Ionic Pillar mark, an animated spinning circular loader, and a live countdown timer (`Checking in 5s...`).
- **Background Health Probes:** A non-blocking background thread pool (`networkExecutor`) executes lightweight `HEAD` requests to `https://arena.ai` via `HttpURLConnection` every 5 seconds.
- **Zero-Touch Auto-Recovery:** The instant network connectivity is restored (e.g. Wi-Fi re-established or Airplane Mode turned off), the app automatically cancels the timer, dismisses the error view, and loads `https://arena.ai` seamlessly.
- **Manual Override:** A prominent **"Retry Now"** button is also provided for immediate manual reconnection.

---

### 5. Authentic Adaptive Branding & Material You Support

The application delivers a first-class, authentic home screen presence matching modern Android design guidelines:

- **Adaptive Vector Drawables:**
  - Foreground (`@drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`): Vector representation of the Classical Ionic Pillar mark centered on a 108dp adaptive canvas.
  - Background (`@drawable/ic_launcher_background.xml`): Solid AMOLED `#000000` deep black.
  - Themed Monochrome (`@drawable/ic_launcher_monochrome.xml`): Android 13+ (API 33+) dynamic Material You icon that automatically tints to match the user's wallpaper color palette.
- **Dual Adaptive XML Manifestations:** Configured in `res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml` and `ic_launcher_round.xml`.
- **Comprehensive Density Raster Fallbacks:** Includes pre-rendered 32-bit RGBA icons across all standard Android density buckets: `mdpi` (48x48), `hdpi` (72x72), `xhdpi` (96x96), `xxhdpi` (144x144), and `xxxhdpi` (192x192).

---

### 6. Multi-Scheme Cryptographic Signing (v1, v2, v3)

- **Multi-Scheme Signing:** Builds from `android/` enable **APK Signature Scheme v1** (JAR signing), **v2** and **v3** (`v1SigningEnabled`, `v2SigningEnabled`, `enableV3Signing` in `android/app/build.gradle`).
- **Stable Release Key:** The release keystore is supplied through `ARENA_RELEASE_STORE_FILE` / `ARENA_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` / `ARENA_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` / `ARENA_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` (Gradle properties or environment variables) and GitHub Actions secrets. CI never generates a signing key. Without those values the build warns loudly and falls back to the debug key, which must never be distributed.
- **Android 11–15 Compatible:** v2 and v3 signatures eliminate the *"App not installed as package appears to be invalid"* error on Android 11 through 15.
- **4-Byte Zip Alignment (`zipalign`):** Every uncompressed archive entry (including `resources.arsc`) is 4-byte aligned. `scripts/verify-apk.sh` re-checks this on every build.
- **Historical Artifact:** The `ArenaAI.apk` committed at the repository root is the published **v1.0.3** binary (v1 + v2 signatures). Every build produced by `.github/workflows/release.yml` includes v3.

---

### 7. Client-Side Security & Privacy Hardening

- **Zero Telemetry or Analytics:** No third-party tracking SDKs (Firebase, Adjust, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Sentry) are included in the binary.
- **HTML5 Geolocation Disabled:** `WebSettings.setGeolocationEnabled(false)` prevents web scripts from querying physical device GPS coordinates.
- **Local File System Protection:** `setAllowFileAccess(false)`, `setAllowContentAccess(false)`, `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(false)`, and `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false)` prevent web content from reading private device files via `file://` or content URIs.
- **Cleartext Traffic Disabled:** `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` strictly forbids non-HTTPS HTTP connections at the Android OS network security layer.
- **Application Backup Disabled:** `android:allowBackup="false"` prevents extraction of session cookies and tokens via Android Debug Bridge (`adb backup`).
- **Navigation Security Allow-List:** Embedded WebView navigation is strictly confined to Arena domains (`arena.ai`, `lmarena.ai`) and authorized OAuth identity providers (`accounts.google.com`, `github.com`, `appleid.apple.com`, `auth0.com`). Any external link is automatically handed off to the user's default system browser via `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`.

---

### 8. Native Android Platform UX

- **Predictive Back Navigation:** Migrated from deprecated `onBackPressed()` to AndroidX `OnBackPressedCallback`, preventing navigation glitches on Android 14+ and Android 15/16 (API 34–36).
- **Session & Cookie Persistence:** Explicit calls to `CookieManager.getInstance().flush()` during `onPageFinished`, `onPause`, `onStop`, and `onDestroy` guarantee login cookies survive process restarts.
- **Secondary Window & OAuth Support:** `WebChromeClient.onCreateWindow` creates dedicated fullscreen dialog WebViews with third-party cookie support for popup authentication dialogs.
- **Download Management:** A real `DownloadListener` implementation (see section 9) forwards the WebView's cookies and user agent to Android's `DownloadManager`, resolves `blob:`/`data:` exports, and writes them to Downloads. It is no longer a bare `ACTION_VIEW` hand-off.

---

### 9. Native Web Capability Bridge (No Extra UI)

The app deliberately ships **no navigation bar, toolbar, banner, floating button or menu of its own**. Everything the user sees is the Arena web interface. Native code only fills gaps a bare WebView cannot cover, and it always uses system surfaces (dialogs, share sheet, notification shade, installer) rather than app chrome:

| Web capability | Native behaviour |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<input type="file">` / `capture` | Multi-select file picker plus optional camera capture through the system camera app |
| `alert()` / `confirm()` / `prompt()` | Native `AlertDialog` equivalents (a default WebView silently drops these) |
| `beforeunload` | Confirmation dialog so back navigation cannot silently discard a battle |
| Pull-to-refresh | Arms only when the document *and* every visible nested scroller are at the top; reloads the current page, retries when offline |
| `<video>` fullscreen | `onShowCustomView` / `onHideCustomView` overlay, with back-button exit |
| `navigator.share()` | Origin-locked `WebMessage` bridge to the Android share sheet (`addWebMessageListener`) |
| `blob:` / `data:` download links | Resolved inside the page and written to Downloads via `MediaStore` |
| HTTPS downloads | `DownloadManager` with Arena cookies, progress in the notification shade |
| `window.open()` | OAuth/SSO hosts stay in a tracked popup; ordinary links open in the main view |
| `intent://` / `mailto:` / `tel:` | Parsed and opened by the matching system app, with `browser_fallback_url` support |
| Renderer crash | WebView is destroyed and recreated at the last URL instead of taking the app down |
| HTTP 5xx / TLS failure / offline | AMOLED reconnect screen with native health probes and backoff |

Nothing in this list adds a permanent control to the Arena UI; all of it is either invisible or a transient system dialog.

### Signing Certificate Fingerprints
```text
Owner / Issuer: CN=Arena Mobile Community, OU=Open Source, O=Community, L=San Francisco, ST=CA, C=US
Algorithm:      2048-bit RSA with SHA256withRSA
Validity:       October 12, 2026 to February 27, 2054
SHA-256:        0A:78:95:E6:52:C7:F1:9C:58:8A:DD:1A:B8:40:B4:C5:EE:32:EA:C1:64:55:89:27:0F:34:65:05:99:D3:F2:DE
SHA-1:          DA:EA:97:45:CC:72:1D:E6:F4:D1:8A:A8:DA:43:53:0A:E3:86:BA:A4
```

### Verify Your Download

```bash
# 1. SHA-256 must match the value above and the SHA256SUMS asset
sha256sum ArenaAI.apk        # macOS: shasum -a 256 ArenaAI.apk

# 2. Signing certificate must match the fingerprint above
apksigner verify --print-certs ArenaAI.apk

# 3. Package, version and permissions
aapt dump badging ArenaAI.apk | head -20
```

`scripts/verify-apk.sh` runs all three checks plus 4-byte alignment in one step. Release managers must update the fingerprint table whenever the signing key changes.

---

## 🛠️ Building from Source

To compile the Android client locally:
- **JDK 17** or newer
- **Android SDK** with Platform API 34 and Build Tools installed

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and install the test harness
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Nobody-Anonymous/arena-ai-android.git
cd arena-ai-android
npm ci

# 2. Run the Android unit tests and the audit suite

- **Secondary OAuth Dialogs:** Popup windows spawned by authentication providers are cleanly handled inside modal dialog WebViews via `WebChromeClient.onCreateWindow`.
- **Google Sign-In Policy:** Google enforces strict server-side policies restricting OAuth from embedded WebViews (`Error 403: disallowed_useragent`). The app strips the `; wv` marker from the WebView User-Agent to optimize compatibility. Users encountering Google OAuth restrictions are advised to log in using Email/Password or complete authentication through their default web browser.
